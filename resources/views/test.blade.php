					<h1>IPHONE 7 Review </h1>
					<p>The dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus promise to usher in a new era in mobile photography. 
					The iconic iPhone home button is no longer a physical button, 
					but instead a sophisticated ballet of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that simulate the feel of a button.</p>

					<h1>Google pixl Review</h1>
					<p>he Pixel, Google stepped up to bat, called its shot and knocked it out of the park. And the timing couldn't be more fortunate with Samsung in the midst of an explosive crisis.
						After six years of partnering up with device makers to create its Nexus phones, for the first time Google has stepped out on its own. The Pixel and Pixel XL are the latest additions to its line of in-house products. And while HTC may have put the phones together,
						it was Google that designed, engineered and branded them.

						The gamble paid off. Starting at $649 in the US, Â£599 in the UK and AU$1,079 in Australia, the Pixel is fast, with an elevated, smooth design. Heavy investments in its camera resulted in a nimble shooter too. Though its special portrait mode is poor, it otherwise takes amazing shots that rival those of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus.</p>

				<h1>Samsung S7 reveiw</h1>
				<p>Before the Note 7 fiasco, there was the Galaxy S7 Active debacle, which now looks positively minor in comparison. After introducing the flagship Galaxy S7 to rave reviews in March -- we still love it, by the way -- Samsung trotted out the Galaxy S7 Active, a variant equipped with a beautiful display, speedy processor, microSD card slot, excellent 12-megapixel rear camera, and supersized battery. Unfortunately, it received its share of unwelcome attention for issues related to its most highly-touted feature: waterproofing -- or its lack thereof. Though Samsung has fixed the problem on its manufacturing line -- and we've verified the fix -- the Galaxy S7 Active's inconsistent performance in water sapped our enthusiasm, and we can no longer recommend the phone with complete confidence.

					Meanwhile, Apple has since released its water-resistant iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which appear to live up to their billing when forced to take a dunk. As covered in our full review, the iPhone 7 also takes great photos, provides long battery life, and delivers fast performance, though it lacks a number of the Galaxy Note 7's cutting-edge features such as iris scanner, wireless charging and wrap-around screen.</p>
